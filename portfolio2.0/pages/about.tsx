My curiosity for computers lead me to pursue a CS degree at university, where I also gained over a year of internship experience working in a variety of engineer/dev and design roles.</p>
                <p className="text-justify mb-8 text-sm">My experience lead me to identify front-end development, product design, and full-stack development as the fields Iâ€™d like to specialize in most as of now. I am motivated to keep my skills fresh by completing side projects and reading about cutting-edge advancements in tech such as blockchain, AI/ML, and robotics.  </p>
